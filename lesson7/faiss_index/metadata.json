See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install 'markitdown[all]'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.

At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install 'markitdown[all]'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In",

Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi.

This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this infrastructure facility, DLF had engaged Parsons Brinckerhoff for project management consultancy and construction work had been awarded to IL&FS.[17] Controversies In August 2011, a penalty of \u20b96.3 billion (US$74 million) was imposed on DLF by the Competition Commission of India (CCI)[18] after finding DLF guilty of breaching laws regarding the unfair pricing of goods and services. The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government.

Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles.

Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business.

(Sorry, patent-assertion-entity business). But what if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, patents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. Tesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source. In fact, as Clark Asay pointed out, IBM has already been accused of reneging the promise.

Lawrence Lessig helped set up the Creative Commons in order to facilitate accessible licensing across a wide range of copyright works.73 Open source strategies have also been adopted in other fields of endeavour. There has been open source tactics deployed in respect of plant breeding and agriculture.

Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles.

The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation.109 Seba admits that \u2018an electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs\u2019.110 He predicts that \u2018like other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.\u2019111 It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy.

However, they can also limit the development of a new industry, keep innovation at bay, and smother technological advancement. If we are to use business as a force for good, then we should welcome competition and relax fixation on intellectual property.

Elon Musk has certainly shown a Steve Jobs-like elan and bravura at salesmanship and promotion. The company Tesla Motors has also been involved in battles over other forms of intellectual property \u2014 most notably, in respect of trade marks relating to the United States,145 and China.146 It is striking that the company has not espoused an open source philosophy when it comes to trade mark law.

In China, Tesla Motors encountered a number of troubles in respect of trademark law.152 Professor Eric Lane from Thomas Jefferson School of Law has been following the longstanding conflict, and has provided a useful summary of the dispute: As it sought to expand into the Chinese market, the electric car maker encountered a businessman named Zhan Baosheng who owned registrations for the TESLA (or \u201cTe Si La\u201d transliterated) trademark in China in both English and Chinese. While Zhan\u2019s trademark rights initially blocked Tesla from using the mark there, in early 2014 the company announced that it had resolved the matter though a court decision granting it the right to use the TESLA mark in China.

B. Gigafactory In February 2014, Tesla Motors announced its ambition to establish a Gigafactory: As we at Tesla reach for our goal of producing a mass market electric car in approximately three years, we have an opportunity to leverage our projected demand for lithium ion batteries to reduce their cost faster than previously thought possible. In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.180 178 179 180 Ibid.

What we are trying to address is not the lay of the land today, where there are indeed too many suppliers, most of whom are producing relatively low photonic efficiency solar cells at uncompelling costs, but how we see the future developing. Without decisive action to lay the groundwork today, the massive volume of affordable, high efficiency panels needed for unsubsidized solar power to outcompete fossil fuel grid power simply will not be there when it is needed. SolarCity was founded to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable energy. The sun, that highly convenient and free fusion reactor in the sky, radiates more energy to the Earth in a few hours than the entire human population consumes from all sources in a year. This means that solar panels, paired with batteries to enable power at night, can produce several orders of magnitude more electricity than is consumed by the entirety of human civilization. A cogent assessment of sustainable energy potential from various sources is described well in this Sandia paper:www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf. Even if the solar industry were only to generate 40 percent of the world\u2019s electricity with photovoltaics by 2040, that would mean installing more than 400 GW of solar capacity per year for the next 25 years.

The plans we are announcing today, while substantial compared to current industry, are small in that context.196 There has been much debate about whether this strategy of SolarCity will be successful. More generally, there has been a great optimism about the widespread adoption and diffusion of solar photovoltaics. Tony Seba has highlighted that solar energy \u2013 coupled with innovative 196 Ibid. 50 financial models \u2013 will disrupt traditional business models in respect of energy.197 In his book on Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change, Mark Diesendorf highlights the significance of solar photovoltaics.198 He emphasized: \u2018PV\u2019s low and decreasing prices, huge resource, low environmental and health impacts, low land use compared with agriculture and widely available materials (at least for silicon crystal technologies) gives confidence that, with geographic diversity of collectors, it can make a substantial contribution to future electricity demand.\u2019199 In his essay, \u2018The New Turning Point\u2019, Al Gore has emphasized that the key question in addressing climate change is how \u2018quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a low-carbon civilization\u2019.200 He has been particularly enthusiastic about solar photovoltaics: There is surprising \u2013 even shocking \u2013 good news: Our ability",

The rationale for the downgrade as per the press release issued by ICRA is extracted below: \u201cThe ratings for the bank facilities of Gensol Engineering Limited (GEL) have been downgraded to [ICRA]D following feedback received by ICRA from the company\u2019s lenders about the ongoing delays in debt servicing.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has passed since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financing. 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined.

From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer.

In view of the above, it is prima facie observed that Gensol and its promoters/promoter related entities have funded Wellray for trading in the scrip of Gensol which is a violation of the restrictions contained in section 67 of the Companies Act, 2013. As is also apparent from the trading in the shares of Gensol by Wellray, the latter made handsome gains from the transactions. Disclosures made by the Company 80. It was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, to the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly launched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. However, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and examined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs were in the nature of an expression of willingness with no reference to the price of the vehicle or delivery schedules. Therefore, it prima facie appeared that the Company was making misleading disclosures to investors. 81. In this regard,",

It was found during the visit that there was no manufacturing activity at the plant with only 2-3 labourers present there. The NSE official called for details of electricity bills of the unit and it was observed that the maximum amount billed by Mahavitaran during last 12 months was Rs. 1,57,037.01 for the month of December 2024. Hence, it can be inferred that there has been no manufacturing activity at the plant site which is on a leased property. ___________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 25 of 29 83. In another disclosure dated January 16, 2025, Gensol had informed Exchanges that Gensol and Refex Green Mobility Limited (Refex) were \u201cpleased to announce a strategic tie-up for the transfer of 2,997 electric four-wheelers (e4Ws)\u201d to Refex. As per the said disclosure, Refex would in turn, assume Gensol\u2019s existing loan facility amounting to Rs.315 Crore.

It was noted that the said US Subsidiary was incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis of such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation / rationale. Pledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA 85. As mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol had come down to 35.125% as of March 31, 2025. The promoters now hold 1,33,48,359 shares in the Company. 86. We have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the latest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more pledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible conclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, may be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi.

Need for Interim Directions 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- ___________________________________________________________________________ Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29 intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91.

In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94.

After the war, she researched [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") from around the world, publishing papers on materials she had collected herself as well as cataloging samples collected by others; her collections are now housed at major [herbaria](/wiki/Herbarium \"Herbarium\") in North America and Europe. Born into upper-class society, Brown was educated in Nova Scotia and abroad. Although lacking formal scientific training, she has been recognized for her contributions to bryology and as an authority on the mosses and [liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\") of Nova Scotia. At the age of 84, Brown was awarded an honorary MA degree from [Acadia University](/wiki/Acadia_University \"Acadia University\") after declining their offer of a PhD.

Early in her career she was involved with gathering [sphagnum moss](/wiki/Sphagnum \"Sphagnum\") to be used as [surgical dressings](/wiki/Dressing_%28medicine%29 \"Dressing (medicine)\") during World War I, when cotton was in short supply. After the war, she researched [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") from around the world, publishing papers on materials she had collected herself as well as cataloging samples collected by others; her collections are now housed at major [herbaria](/wiki/Herbarium \"Herbarium\") in North America and Europe. Born into upper-class society, Brown was educated in Nova Scotia and abroad. Although lacking formal scientific training, she has been recognized for her contributions to bryology and as an authority on the mosses and [liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\") of Nova Scotia. At the age of 84, Brown was awarded an honorary MA degree from [Acadia University](/wiki/Acadia_University \"Acadia University\") after declining their offer of a PhD. She died at her home in [Halifax](/wiki/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia \"Halifax, Nova Scotia\") aged 95 and in 2010 was posthumously inducted into the Nova Scotia Scientific Hall of Fame.

Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be [parsed](/wiki/Parsing \"Parsing\"), searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping). As well as [contact scraping](/wiki/Contact_scraping \"Contact scraping\"), web scraping is used as a component of applications used for [web indexing](/wiki/Web_indexing \"Web indexing\"), [web mining](/wiki/Web_mining \"Web mining\") and [data mining](/wiki/Data_mining \"Data mining\"), online price change monitoring and [price comparison](/wiki/Comparison_shopping_website \"Comparison shopping website\"), product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, [website change detection](/wiki/Change_detection_and_notification \"Change detection and notification\"), research, tracking online presence and reputation, [web mashup](/wiki/Web_mashup \"Web mashup\"), and [web data integration](/wiki/Web_data_integration \"Web data integration\").

However, most web pages are designed for human [end-users](/wiki/End-user_%28computer_science%29 \"End-user (computer science)\") and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include [market research](/wiki/Market_research \"Market research\"), price comparison, content monitoring, and more. Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data. Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring [data feeds](/wiki/Data_feed \"Data feed\") from web servers. For example, [JSON](/wiki/JSON \"JSON\") is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server. There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving [DOM](/wiki/Document_Object_Model \"Document Object Model\") parsing, [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\") and [natural language processing](/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\") to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing. ## History [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")] After the [birth of the World Wide Web](/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web \"History of the World Wide Web\") in 1989, the first web robot,[[2]](#cite_note-2) [World Wide Web Wanderer](/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Wanderer \"World Wide Web Wanderer\"), was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.

In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, [JumpStation](/wiki/JumpStation \"JumpStation\"), was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, Jump Station was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot. In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An [API](/wiki/Application_programming_interface \"Application programming interface\") (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, [Salesforce](/wiki/Salesforce.com \"Salesforce.com\") and [eBay](/wiki/EBay \"EBay\") launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database. ## Techniques [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Techniques\")] Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the [semantic web](/wiki/Semantic_web \"Semantic web\") vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and [human-computer interactions](/wiki/Human-computer_interaction \"Human-computer interaction\"). ### Human copy-and-paste [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Human copy-and-paste\")] The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet.

Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation. ### Text pattern matching [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Text pattern matching\")] A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX [grep](/wiki/Grep \"Grep\") command or [regular expression](/wiki/Regular_expression \"Regular expression\")-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance [Perl](/wiki/Perl \"Perl\") or [Python](/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29 \"Python (programming language)\")). ### HTTP programming [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: HTTP programming\")] [Static](/wiki/Static_web_page \"Static web page\") and [dynamic web pages](/wiki/Dynamic_web_page \"Dynamic web page\") can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using [socket programming](/wiki/Socket_programming \"Socket programming\"). ### HTML parsing [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: HTML parsing\")] Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called a [wrapper](/wiki/Wrapper_%28data_mining%29 \"Wrapper (data mining)\"). Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[[3]](#cite_note-3) Moreover, some [semi-structured data](/wiki/Semi-structured_data",

This method can be especially useful for scraping data from dynamic sites since a web browser will fully load each page. Once an entire page is loaded, you can access and parse the [DOM](/wiki/Document_Object_Model \"Document Object Model\") using an expression language such as [XPath](/wiki/XPath \"XPath\"). ### Vertical aggregation [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Vertical aggregation\")] There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of \"bots\" for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale",

The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the [Long Tail](/wiki/Long_Tail \"Long Tail\") of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from. ### Semantic annotation recognizing [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Semantic annotation recognizing\")] The pages being scraped may embrace [metadata](/wiki/Metadata \"Metadata\") or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as [Microformat](/wiki/Microformat \"Microformat\") does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[[4]](#cite_note-4) are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages. ### Computer vision web-page analysis [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Computer vision web-page analysis\")] There are efforts using [machine learning](/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") and [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\") that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[[5]](#cite_note-5) ### AI-powered document understanding [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: AI-powered document understanding\")] Uses advanced AI to interpret and process web page content contextually, extracting relevant information, transforming data, and customizing outputs based on the content's structure and meaning.

In general, web scraping may be against the [terms of service](/wiki/Terms_of_service \"Terms of service\") of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[[6]](#cite_note-6) ### United States [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: United States\")] In the United States, website owners can use three major [legal claims](/wiki/Cause_of_action \"Cause of action\") to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act \"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\") (\"CFAA\"), and (3) [trespass to chattel](/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels \"Trespass to chattels\").[[7]](#cite_note-7) However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving.

For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in [*Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service*](/wiki/Feist_Publications%2C_Inc.%2C_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co. \"Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.\") that duplication of facts is allowable. U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of \"scrapers\" or \"robots\" may be held liable for committing [trespass to chattels](/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels \"Trespass to chattels\"),[[8]](#cite_note-8)[[9]](#cite_note-9) which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, *[eBay v. Bidder's Edge](/wiki/EBay_v._Bidder%27s_Edge \"EBay v. Bidder's Edge\")*, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as [auction sniping](/wiki/Auction_sniping \"Auction sniping\"). However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to [chattels](/wiki/Personal_property \"Personal property\"), the [plaintiff](/wiki/Plaintiff \"Plaintiff\") must demonstrate that the [defendant](/wiki/Defendant \"Defendant\") intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[[10]](#cite_note-10) One of the first major tests of [screen scraping](/wiki/Screen_scraping \"Screen scraping\") involved [American Airlines](/wiki/American_Airlines \"American Airlines\") (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[[11]](#cite_note-11) AA successfully obtained an [injunction](/wiki/Injunction \"Injunction\") from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare",

The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[[12]](#cite_note-12) [Southwest Airlines](/wiki/Southwest_Airlines \"Southwest Airlines\") has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be [US Copyright law](/wiki/US_Copyright_law \"US Copyright law\") and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the [Supreme Court of the United States](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United States\"), FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company [Yahoo!](/wiki/Yahoo%21 \"Yahoo!\"), and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[[13]](#cite_note-impervawp2011-13)",

Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in *[Craigslist v. 3Taps](/wiki/Craigslist_v._3Taps \"Craigslist v. 3Taps\")*. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act \"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\") (CFAA). Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[[14]](#cite_note-14) While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site.

Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be [parsed](/wiki/Parsing \"Parsing\"), searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping). As well as [contact scraping](/wiki/Contact_scraping \"Contact scraping\"), web scraping is used as a component of applications used for [web indexing](/wiki/Web_indexing \"Web indexing\"), [web mining](/wiki/Web_mining \"Web mining\") and [data mining](/wiki/Data_mining \"Data mining\"), online price change monitoring and [price comparison](/wiki/Comparison_shopping_website \"Comparison shopping website\"), product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, [website change detection](/wiki/Change_detection_and_notification \"Change detection and notification\"), research, tracking online presence and reputation, [web mashup](/wiki/Web_mashup \"Web mashup\"), and [web data integration](/wiki/Web_data_integration \"Web data integration\").

However, most web pages are designed for human [end-users](/wiki/End-user_%28computer_science%29 \"End-user (computer science)\") and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include [market research](/wiki/Market_research \"Market research\"), price comparison, content monitoring, and more. Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data. Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring [data feeds](/wiki/Data_feed \"Data feed\") from web servers. For example, [JSON](/wiki/JSON \"JSON\") is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server. There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving [DOM](/wiki/Document_Object_Model \"Document Object Model\") parsing, [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\") and [natural language processing](/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\") to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing. ## History [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")] After the [birth of the World Wide Web](/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web \"History of the World Wide Web\") in 1989, the first web robot,[[2]](#cite_note-2) [World Wide Web Wanderer](/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Wanderer \"World Wide Web Wanderer\"), was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.

In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, [JumpStation](/wiki/JumpStation \"JumpStation\"), was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, Jump Station was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot. In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An [API](/wiki/Application_programming_interface \"Application programming interface\") (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, [Salesforce](/wiki/Salesforce.com \"Salesforce.com\") and [eBay](/wiki/EBay \"EBay\") launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database. ## Techniques [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Techniques\")] Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the [semantic web](/wiki/Semantic_web \"Semantic web\") vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and [human-computer interactions](/wiki/Human-computer_interaction \"Human-computer interaction\"). ### Human copy-and-paste [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Human copy-and-paste\")] The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet.

Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation. ### Text pattern matching [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Text pattern matching\")] A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX [grep](/wiki/Grep \"Grep\") command or [regular expression](/wiki/Regular_expression \"Regular expression\")-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance [Perl](/wiki/Perl \"Perl\") or [Python](/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29 \"Python (programming language)\")). ### HTTP programming [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: HTTP programming\")] [Static](/wiki/Static_web_page \"Static web page\") and [dynamic web pages](/wiki/Dynamic_web_page \"Dynamic web page\") can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using [socket programming](/wiki/Socket_programming \"Socket programming\"). ### HTML parsing [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: HTML parsing\")] Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called a [wrapper](/wiki/Wrapper_%28data_mining%29 \"Wrapper (data mining)\"). Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[[3]](#cite_note-3) Moreover, some [semi-structured data](/wiki/Semi-structured_data",

This method can be especially useful for scraping data from dynamic sites since a web browser will fully load each page. Once an entire page is loaded, you can access and parse the [DOM](/wiki/Document_Object_Model \"Document Object Model\") using an expression language such as [XPath](/wiki/XPath \"XPath\"). ### Vertical aggregation [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Vertical aggregation\")] There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of \"bots\" for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale",

The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the [Long Tail](/wiki/Long_Tail \"Long Tail\") of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from. ### Semantic annotation recognizing [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Semantic annotation recognizing\")] The pages being scraped may embrace [metadata](/wiki/Metadata \"Metadata\") or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as [Microformat](/wiki/Microformat \"Microformat\") does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[[4]](#cite_note-4) are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages. ### Computer vision web-page analysis [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Computer vision web-page analysis\")] There are efforts using [machine learning](/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") and [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\") that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[[5]](#cite_note-5) ### AI-powered document understanding [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: AI-powered document understanding\")] Uses advanced AI to interpret and process web page content contextually, extracting relevant information, transforming data, and customizing outputs based on the content's structure and meaning.

In general, web scraping may be against the [terms of service](/wiki/Terms_of_service \"Terms of service\") of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[[6]](#cite_note-6) ### United States [[edit](/w/index.php?title=Web_scraping&action=edit&section=13 \"Edit section: United States\")] In the United States, website owners can use three major [legal claims](/wiki/Cause_of_action \"Cause of action\") to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act \"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\") (\"CFAA\"), and (3) [trespass to chattel](/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels \"Trespass to chattels\").[[7]](#cite_note-7) However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving.

For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in [*Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service*](/wiki/Feist_Publications%2C_Inc.%2C_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co. \"Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.\") that duplication of facts is allowable. U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of \"scrapers\" or \"robots\" may be held liable for committing [trespass to chattels](/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels \"Trespass to chattels\"),[[8]](#cite_note-8)[[9]](#cite_note-9) which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, *[eBay v. Bidder's Edge](/wiki/EBay_v._Bidder%27s_Edge \"EBay v. Bidder's Edge\")*, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as [auction sniping](/wiki/Auction_sniping \"Auction sniping\"). However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to [chattels](/wiki/Personal_property \"Personal property\"), the [plaintiff](/wiki/Plaintiff \"Plaintiff\") must demonstrate that the [defendant](/wiki/Defendant \"Defendant\") intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[[10]](#cite_note-10) One of the first major tests of [screen scraping](/wiki/Screen_scraping \"Screen scraping\") involved [American Airlines](/wiki/American_Airlines \"American Airlines\") (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[[11]](#cite_note-11) AA successfully obtained an [injunction](/wiki/Injunction \"Injunction\") from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare",

The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[[12]](#cite_note-12) [Southwest Airlines](/wiki/Southwest_Airlines \"Southwest Airlines\") has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be [US Copyright law](/wiki/US_Copyright_law \"US Copyright law\") and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the [Supreme Court of the United States](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United States\"), FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company [Yahoo!](/wiki/Yahoo%21 \"Yahoo!\"), and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[[13]](#cite_note-impervawp2011-13)",

Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in *[Craigslist v. 3Taps](/wiki/Craigslist_v._3Taps \"Craigslist v. 3Taps\")*. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act \"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\") (CFAA). Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[[14]](#cite_note-14) While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site.

Early in her career she was involved with gathering [sphagnum moss](/wiki/Sphagnum \"Sphagnum\") to be used as [surgical dressings](/wiki/Dressing_%28medicine%29 \"Dressing (medicine)\") during World War I, when cotton was in short supply.

Born into upper-class society, Brown was educated in Nova Scotia and abroad. Although lacking formal scientific training, she has been recognized for her contributions to bryology and as an authority on the mosses and [liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\") of Nova Scotia. At the age of 84, Brown was awarded an honorary MA degree from [Acadia University](/wiki/Acadia_University \"Acadia University\") after declining their offer of a PhD.

Early in her career she was involved with gathering [sphagnum moss](/wiki/Sphagnum \"Sphagnum\") to be used as [surgical dressings](/wiki/Dressing_%28medicine%29 \"Dressing (medicine)\") during World War I, when cotton was in short supply. After the war, she researched [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") from around the world, publishing papers on materials she had collected herself as well as cataloging samples collected by others; her collections are now housed at major [herbaria](/wiki/Herbarium \"Herbarium\") in North America and Europe. Born into upper-class society, Brown was educated in Nova Scotia and abroad. Although lacking formal scientific training, she has been recognized for her contributions to bryology and as an authority on the mosses and [liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\") of Nova Scotia. At the age of 84, Brown was awarded an honorary MA degree from [Acadia University](/wiki/Acadia_University \"Acadia University\") after declining their offer of a PhD. She died at her home in [Halifax](/wiki/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia \"Halifax, Nova Scotia\") aged 95 and in 2010 was posthumously inducted into the Nova Scotia Scientific Hall of Fame.

Early in her career she was involved with gathering [sphagnum moss](/wiki/Sphagnum \"Sphagnum\") to be used as [surgical dressings](/wiki/Dressing_%28medicine%29 \"Dressing (medicine)\") during World War I, when cotton was in short supply. After the war, she researched [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") from around the world, publishing papers on materials she had collected herself as well as cataloging samples collected by others; her collections are now housed at major [herbaria](/wiki/Herbarium \"Herbarium\") in North America and Europe. Born into upper-class society, Brown was educated in Nova Scotia and abroad. Although lacking formal scientific training, she has been recognized for her contributions to bryology and as an authority on the mosses and [liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\") of Nova Scotia. At the age of 84, Brown was awarded an honorary MA degree from [Acadia University](/wiki/Acadia_University \"Acadia University\") after declining their offer of a PhD. She died at her home in [Halifax](/wiki/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia \"Halifax, Nova Scotia\") aged 95 and in 2010 was posthumously inducted into the Nova Scotia Scientific Hall of Fame.

The official story would later be that two hand-picked soldiers, [Meliton Kantaria](/wiki/Meliton_Kantaria \"Meliton Kantaria\") (Georgian) and [Mikhail Yegorov](/wiki/Mikhail_Yegorov \"Mikhail Yegorov\") (Russian), raised the Soviet flag over the Reichstag, However, according to Khaldei himself, when he arrived at the Reichstag, he simply asked the soldiers who happened to be passing by to help with the staging of the photoshoot; the one who was attaching the flag was 18-year-old Private Kovalev from Burlin, [Kazakhstan](/wiki/Kazakhstan \"Kazakhstan\"); the two others were [Abdulkhakim Ismailov](/wiki/Abdulkhakim_Ismailov \"Abdulkhakim Ismailov\") from [Dagestan](/wiki/Dagestan \"Dagestan\") and Leonid Gorychev (also mentioned as Aleksei Goryachev) from [Minsk](/wiki/Minsk \"Minsk\").

After the war, she researched [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") from around the world, publishing papers on materials she had collected herself as well as cataloging samples collected by others; her collections are now housed at major [herbaria](/wiki/Herbarium \"Herbarium\") in North America and Europe.

The Reichstag was seen as symbolic of, and at the heart of, Nazi Germany. It was arguably the most symbolic target in Berlin. After its capture on 2 May 1945, Khaldei scaled the now pacified Reichstag to take a picture. He was carrying with him a large flag, sewn from three tablecloths for this very purpose, by his uncle. The official story would later be that two hand-picked soldiers, [Meliton Kantaria](/wiki/Meliton_Kantaria \"Meliton Kantaria\") (Georgian) and [Mikhail Yegorov](/wiki/Mikhail_Yegorov \"Mikhail Yegorov\") (Russian), raised the Soviet flag over the Reichstag, However, according to Khaldei himself, when he arrived at the Reichstag, he simply asked the soldiers who happened to be passing by to help with the staging of the photoshoot; the one who was attaching the flag was 18-year-old Private Kovalev from Burlin, [Kazakhstan](/wiki/Kazakhstan \"Kazakhstan\"); the two others were [Abdulkhakim Ismailov](/wiki/Abdulkhakim_Ismailov \"Abdulkhakim Ismailov\") from [Dagestan](/wiki/Dagestan \"Dagestan\") and Leonid Gorychev (also mentioned as Aleksei Goryachev) from [Minsk](/wiki/Minsk \"Minsk\").

Early in her career she was involved with gathering [sphagnum moss](/wiki/Sphagnum \"Sphagnum\") to be used as [surgical dressings](/wiki/Dressing_%28medicine%29 \"Dressing (medicine)\") during World War I, when cotton was in short supply. After the war, she researched [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") from around the world, publishing papers on materials she had collected herself as well as cataloging samples collected by others; her collections are now housed at major [herbaria](/wiki/Herbarium \"Herbarium\") in North America and Europe. Born into upper-class society, Brown was educated in Nova Scotia and abroad. Although lacking formal scientific training, she has been recognized for her contributions to bryology and as an authority on the mosses and [liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\") of Nova Scotia. At the age of 84, Brown was awarded an honorary MA degree from [Acadia University](/wiki/Acadia_University \"Acadia University\") after declining their offer of a PhD. She died at her home in [Halifax](/wiki/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia \"Halifax, Nova Scotia\") aged 95 and in 2010 was posthumously inducted into the Nova Scotia Scientific Hall of Fame.

Early in her career she was involved with gathering [sphagnum moss](/wiki/Sphagnum \"Sphagnum\") to be used as [surgical dressings](/wiki/Dressing_%28medicine%29 \"Dressing (medicine)\") during World War I, when cotton was in short supply. After the war, she researched [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") from around the world, publishing papers on materials she had collected herself as well as cataloging samples collected by others; her collections are now housed at major [herbaria](/wiki/Herbarium \"Herbarium\") in North America and Europe. Born into upper-class society, Brown was educated in Nova Scotia and abroad. Although lacking formal scientific training, she has been recognized for her contributions to bryology and as an authority on the mosses and [liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\") of Nova Scotia. At the age of 84, Brown was awarded an honorary MA degree from [Acadia University](/wiki/Acadia_University \"Acadia University\") after declining their offer of a PhD.

The Reichstag was seen as symbolic of, and at the heart of, Nazi Germany. It was arguably the most symbolic target in Berlin. After its capture on 2 May 1945, Khaldei scaled the now pacified Reichstag to take a picture. He was carrying with him a large flag, sewn from three tablecloths for this very purpose, by his uncle. The official story would later be that two hand-picked soldiers, [Meliton Kantaria](/wiki/Meliton_Kantaria \"Meliton Kantaria\") (Georgian) and [Mikhail Yegorov](/wiki/Mikhail_Yegorov \"Mikhail Yegorov\") (Russian), raised the Soviet flag over the Reichstag, However, according to Khaldei himself, when he arrived at the Reichstag, he simply asked the soldiers who happened to be passing by to help with the staging of the photoshoot; the one who was attaching the flag was 18-year-old Private Kovalev from Burlin, [Kazakhstan](/wiki/Kazakhstan \"Kazakhstan\"); the two others were [Abdulkhakim Ismailov](/wiki/Abdulkhakim_Ismailov \"Abdulkhakim Ismailov\") from [Dagestan](/wiki/Dagestan \"Dagestan\") and Leonid Gorychev (also mentioned as Aleksei Goryachev) from [Minsk](/wiki/Minsk \"Minsk\").

Early in her career she was involved with gathering [sphagnum moss](/wiki/Sphagnum \"Sphagnum\") to be used as [surgical dressings](/wiki/Dressing_%28medicine%29 \"Dressing (medicine)\") during World War I, when cotton was in short supply. After the war, she researched [mosses](/wiki/Moss \"Moss\") from around the world, publishing papers on materials she had collected herself as well as cataloging samples collected by others; her collections are now housed at major [herbaria](/wiki/Herbarium \"Herbarium\") in North America and Europe. Born into upper-class society, Brown was educated in Nova Scotia and abroad. Although lacking formal scientific training, she has been recognized for her contributions to bryology and as an authority on the mosses and [liverworts](/wiki/Marchantiophyta \"Marchantiophyta\") of Nova Scotia. At the age of 84, Brown was awarded an honorary MA degree from [Acadia University](/wiki/Acadia_University \"Acadia University\") after declining their offer of a PhD. She died at her home in [Halifax](/wiki/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia \"Halifax, Nova Scotia\") aged 95 and in 2010 was posthumously inducted into the Nova Scotia Scientific Hall of Fame.

The world of discounts, deals and hauls \u2013 hallmarks of popular Chinese online shopping giants Shein and Temu \u2013 could be coming to an end. Starting Friday, American shoppers will be paying import duties, per item, on their orders from China, as the U.S. government ends a legal loophole that once exempted tariffs on low-value packages shipped from China. The Trump administration [says](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-closes-de-minimis-exemptions-to-combat-chinas-role-in-americas-synthetic-opioid-crisis/) the move is to counter fentanyl trafficking. \"President Trump is targeting deceptive shipping practices by Chinese-based shippers, many of whom hide illicit substances, including synthetic opioids, in low-value packages to exploit the *de minimis*exemption,\" the White House [said in an executive order mandating the new levies](/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5350588/temu-shein-tariff-shopping). ### Shock and awe among shoppers Some shoppers have already seen the effect of the tariffs when they looked at the final bill on eorders that will start arriving on Friday, May 2. --- Related Story: [NPR](/g-s1-63825) --- Shocked with the higher prices, some have posted screenshots of their import duties on social media in the days before duties started. One of them, Amanda Norris, an accountant in Tampa, had selected a few pet harness options that she wanted to buy on Temu a few weeks ago but forgot to complete the order.

When she went back and checked her shopping basket, she noticed the estimated total cost had more than doubled. \"The total for the two dog harnesses came to like $33, but then the import charges were an additional $46 and change, so it brought the whole total for the two dog harnesses up to 80 something dollars,\" she told NPR. --- Related Story: [NPR](/nx-s1-5380204) --- --- Related Story: [NPR](/nx-s1-5375820) --- Norris, who says she tends to \"thrift almost everything,\" will now be looking for her shopping elsewhere. ### The story behind the *de minimus* loophole For almost a century, U.S. law carved out a duty exemption for small packages. The idea was that if you are visiting another country and want to ship something small back home, you would not have to pay an import tax. The loophole was called *de minimis*, which is Latin for something trivial and insignificant. Over time, this little exemption became huge business because of online shopping. That is where Shein and Temu came in, along with TikTok Shop and Amazon's many Chinese sellers. About a decade ago, Congress expanded the exemption to packages worth under $800. So any package, from clothes to kitchenware, under that price point would come in duty-free and pass inspection faster. Online sellers realized this was a big advantage. --- Related Story:",

So any package, from clothes to kitchenware, under that price point would come in duty-free and pass inspection faster. Online sellers realized this was a big advantage. --- Related Story: [NPR](/nx-s1-5332209) --- Shein and Temu mostly ship directly from their Chinese suppliers to your doorstep in the U.S. duty-free, saving millions of dollars, which is one of the reasons why they have been able to charge lower prices, like $10 for a shirt or $30 for a dresser. The mass appeal from those cost savings helped catapult them from companies no one had heard of to being wildly popular and among the fastest growing online retailers. ### Why the loophole was closed Last September, the [Biden administration](https://web.archive.org/web/20250116045446/https%3A//www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/13/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-protect-american-consumers-workers-and-businesses-by-cracking-down-on-de-minimis-shipments-with-unsafe-unfairly-traded-products/) [moved to close that loophole](/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5111427/shein-temu-white-house-biden-rule-china), saying it not only presents drug enforcement problems but also harms U.S. businesses and workers and makes it harder to enforce health and safety laws. The *de minimis* exemption was also not great for the U.S. government, which was missing out on tax revenue from these packages, nor for American companies who said they could not compete with those low prices. U.S. lawmakers also [warn](http://www.chrome-extension/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https%3A/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/fast-fashion-and-the-uyghur-genocide-interim-findings.pdf) some goods sold via Shein or Temu could be produced by forced labor in China or [are counterfeits](https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2024/8/sen-rick-scott-urges-department-of-commerce-to-investigate-ccp-linked-temu), an allegation European lawmakers [are investigating](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-investigates-temu-over-illegal-products/a-70649434). \"While most shipments contain legitimate goods, many contain fake or dangerous products that can put American consumers and businesses at serious risk,\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) warned in a new video this week.",

She points out that with the new customs duties on low-value packages from China, importers will now need to fill out information where every small package is coming from and what is inside them. It means a lot more work for brokers and for American customs officials. \"But they're going to have so much more information in their system that will help them figure out which container has the illicit packages,\" Murphy says, of CBP. Trade enforcement experts are warning international shipping will experience massive delays as both customs brokers and U.S. customs officials transition to the more rigorous vetting standards. \"Now that everything needs to go through a formal entry process, it is beyond the capacity of consumers, logistic operators, and carriers who until yesterday",

Chinese shopping apps like Temu are now promoting what they call \"local\" goods: items already in warehouses in the U.S. which American customers will not need to pay import duties on.

Chinese imports into the U.S. now [face a crippling 145% tariff](/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5357645/trump-tariffs-paused), after Washington and Beijing engaged in tit-for-tat tariff increases last month. With few exceptions, U.S. goods flowing into China are [subject to tariffs of 125%](/2025/04/12/g-s1-59682/trump-tariffs-farmers-china).

Trump and administration officials have said they believe China wants to talk, and that tariffs will eventually be reduced. In an interview on Fox News on Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said China wants to reach \"some sort of short-term accommodation\". \"The Chinese are reaching out. They want to meet.

Trump has said at times in recent days that talks were already under way. Chinese officials deny that. \"China's position on the issue has been consistent: If it's a fight, we'll fight. If it's talks, the door is open,\" the commerce ministry said in a statement. \"In any possible dialogue or talks, if the United States side does not rectify its erroneous unilateral tariff measures, it will show that the United States side is totally insincere and will further undermine mutual trust between the two sides,\" the ministry added. --- Related Story: [NPR](/nx-s1-5357645) --- \"Saying one thing but doing another, or even attempting to engage in coercion and blackmail under the guise of talks, will not work on the Chinese side.\" Topics * [News](/1001) * [Culture](/1008) * [Music](/1039) - [Contact Us](/614470770) - [Terms of Use](/179876898) - [Permissions](/179881519) - [Privacy Policy](/179878450) \u00a9 NPR",
